Shutter
=======
Shutter is an animation library for LÖVE. It accepts all of LÖVE's drawable objects as well as functions which could be used to draw objects not native to LÖVE. Shutter does not have an update method. Instead, you must advance each frame (or frames) yourself. This gives you flexibility in the event that you need things to go faster or slower than normal.

***NOTE: Shutter is, as of now, untested.***
